## Some projects I've worked on

### Optimizing Crisis Response Data Queries

In this project, our team _404NotFound_ designed and built a **MySQL** relational database from raw public crisis response CSV data. As the database designer and developer, I focused on schema design, indexing strategy, and query optimization to improve performance. By analyzing execution plans and tuning indexes, our team resulting in a **72%** improvement in query execution time and a **70%** reduction in full-table scans.

### Data-Driven Analysis of YouTube Trending Videos
This project was motivated by a desire to understand what actually drives videos onto YouTube’s Trending page, beyond surface-level view counts. Using a large U.S. trending dataset with **260,000+** data from 2020–2024, we cleaned, engineered new features (like engagement rate and tag count), and built interactive Vega-Lite visualizations to explore patterns across categories, time, and engagement metrics. The key insight was that trending behavior varies significantly by category and over time, and that simple metadata such as tags and engagement ratios can reveal meaningful differences in popularity dynamics. By focusing on interactive exploration rather than static charts, the project helps content creators, marketers, and analysts ask and answer their own questions about how YouTube trends evolve.
